      Thomas was born in the year 1996 in the small UK town of Kettering. Ever since he first layed eyes on his first video game, played on the classic Sega Mega Drive, he grew ever facinated by the concept! Now, 20 years later, he is a confident young adult study for a Computer Games Design degree at Northampton University.
      Being serious for a moment, I am 20 year old male hoping to someday work in the video games industry. My biggest hobbies all involve video games, whether thats programming them, playing them, watching them, or listening to them; my favourite music genre is Chiptune!
